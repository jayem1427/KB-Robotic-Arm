# KB-Robotic-Arm
5 Axis 3D printed Robotic Arm with Gripper, Gamepad support, and costed around $270 USD. 

This repository contains all files related to my fork of the Kauda Robotic Arm: https://www.diy-tech.it/010-kauda

Changes from Original Design:
- Programmed firmware to control of all motors with a Dualshock 4 Gamepad (original design had very basic control)
- Redesigned a few parts for better printability (my parts were all printed on a Prusa Mini with 18x18x18cm build volume)
- Redesigned gears to accept set screws
- WIP new assembly manual (original had missing or incorrect info)
